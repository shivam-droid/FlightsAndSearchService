## DB Design
- Airplane Table
- Flight Table
- City Table
- Airport Table

- A flight belongs to an airplane but one airplane can be used in multiple flights
- A city has many airports but one airport belongs to a city
- One airport can have many flights but a flight belongs to only one airport


## Tables

### City -> id, name, created_at, updated_at
### Airport -> id, name, address, city_id, created_at, updated_At
    Relationship -> City has many airports and Airport belongs to a city (one to many)
    
```
npx sequelize model:generate --name City --attributes name:String
npx sequelize model:generate --name Airport --attributes name:String,address:String,city_id:Integer

npx sequelize db:migrate

npx sequelize seed:generate --name add-airplanes
npx sequelize db:seed:all
```
